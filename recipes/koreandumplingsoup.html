    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This dish is very easy to make. But that isn't why I like to make this dish. It's also because once you buy the ingredients, they come in handy for other Korean dishes. It's a good introductory dish before you foray into the vast Korean cuisine.

    The Korean dumpling soup with rice cakes is simply put a savory broth with typically meat dumplings and rice cakes. It is served hot and is traditionally eaten on New Year's. Eating mandu-guk, as it is called in Korean, marks the beginning of a new year and augurs another year of good health.</p>
    
    
    <p>This is a Korean dish, so I will mostly be using Korean ingredients. You can find them at any Korean grocery store. </p>
