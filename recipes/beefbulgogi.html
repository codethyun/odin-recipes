    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Bulgogi, or Korean barbecue, literally means "fire meat." Thin slices of beef (or sometimes pork) are marinated in a sweet-savory sauce, then grilled to juicy and flavorful perfection.</p>
    
    <p>This recipe is more ambitious than the last two. For you meat-lovers out there, this beef recipe won't only be ample, but it's so finger-licking good that it will surely become a staple in any household.</p>
